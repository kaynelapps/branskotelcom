                    <p class="mb-4">All new products sold by Branskotel come with the manufacturer's warranty. The duration and terms of the warranty vary by manufacturer and product. Refurbished products come with our own warranty, typically 90 days from the date of purchase, covering defects in materials and workmanship.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">For warranty service, please contact our customer service team. We will assist you with the warranty claim process, which may involve returning the product to us or directly to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mb-3">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                    <p class="mb-5">Our liability is limited to the amount paid for the product or service that is the subject of the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>
